    "about": " Hi Everyone!\n\nI recently pivoted away from an amazing career in the coffee and hospitality industry to pursue a passion for web development.\n\nI joined a bootcamp at DevMountain in order to absorb everything I can - I've been problem solving, developing apps, and loving it ever since.\n\nOutside of developing, I enjoy cooking, watching soccer, and photography!\n\n\n\n-Ryan",
